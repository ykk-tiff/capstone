Yukie's Image ML Capstone
=========================

**Project Overview**
Problem Area:
AI-assisted medical image analysis for chronic kidney disease has not been
extensively developed. A problem area this project can solve is to detect functional tissue units, which are robust glomeruli, within kidney tissue images.

**Walkthrough Demo**

**Project Flowchart**
1. Load and evaluate the data
2. EDA
3. Build the model
4. Finetunning the ML
