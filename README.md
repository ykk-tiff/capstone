# Using ML To Inspire A New Future For Pathology - Colon Tissue Image Classification 

## A Capstone Project By Yukie Kuang 

**Project Overview**
<br>Microscopic analysis of tissue morphology, a cornerstone in pathology, often leads to ambiguous results despite its widespread use. This ambiguity can lead to additional testing, affecting both efficiency and patient care.

This project utilizes a dataset from a 2022 deep learning study taken from the hospital in Chaoyang, Beijing and another from MHIST, available on GitHub, to accurately classify hematoxylin and eosin-stained colon tissue samples, ranging from benign to cancerous. Employing convolutional neural networks, the primary aim is to screen and classify colon tissue bopsies. In doing so, the secondary aim of this project is to deeply investigate and comprehend the challenges AI encounters in the classification and analysis of tissue images.
