# Sprinte 3

## Description
In Sprint 3, we will enhance the code from Sprint 2 to include functionality for retrieving dataset names alongside other data, such as images and labels. We will not address class imbalance issues within the MHIST dataset due to added complexity and time constraints. Instead, our focus will be on ensuring robust data integration and functionality improvements, leaving the possibility of tackling MHIST and Chaoyang class imbalance in future project iterations after assessing the integration impact.

These changes will ensure that modifications made during Sprint 2 are preserved, paving the way for preliminary modeling with advanced models like simple CNNs and ResNet18 in subsequent steps.
